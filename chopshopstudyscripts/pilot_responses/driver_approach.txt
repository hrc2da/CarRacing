* The AI seems to constantly adjust its position with a 'left' or 'right' turn at every timestep, along with some nonzero acceleration.

* The driver seems to make very little effort to stay on the track. They turn very slightly in the wrong direction at the first turn.

* It just goes in a straight line, except for one trial where it went off track and kept spinning.

* It does not seem to follow the track at all.

* He keeps accelerating. He never brakes. He most time does not turn. 

* lol it's bad, it doesn't really know to steer

* The driver appears to be "driving" but with very little control. 

* The driver right now doesnt know much about how to make it around the track. It seems to basically hit the gas once or twice and hope for the best. 

* The driver always chooses to move forward and turn slightly right (except in one video where the driver veered hard right).

* The driver goes the opposite direction when it's supposed to turn.

* - Drives very straight until there is a bend in the track
- Bend in track is always a left turn, and the driver always turns right (sometimes at varying angles)
- After driving off the track, either keeps driving straight until the edge of the world is hit or would make weird circles

* turning left when it's supposed to turn left.
