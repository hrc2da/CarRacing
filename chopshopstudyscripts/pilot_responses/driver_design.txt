* Modifying the horsepower, steering sensitivity, and the brake sensitivity will help with turns, and from there I can adjust the actual car shape for further optimization.

* I think making the car easier to turn would help. Also, maybe if it was made slower, the driver would be able to complete the turns

* Add steering capability

* give it capability to sense the lane.

* Maybe help the car slow down a bit, so the driver will have more opportunity to practice its turning before getting out of the track. 

* umm... make the steering less sensitive

* I wonder if they are braking but the brakes aren't sensitive enough? Or the tires might need a different tread. 

* Im thinking perhaps make the car a lot slower, so that the driver has more time to recognize when it needs to turn.

* I could potentially make the wheels unbalanced in a way that favors leftward motion. Alternatively, I could slow down the car so that the driver can control more of the motion.

* Make the car turn the right direction.

* - How sensitive the wheels are to turning

* signal when going off track; slowing down when making turns.
