move updated anna study to carRacingTest2
rerun h1human for the finished data

generate a fixed set of maps and/or figure out if seeding will generate identical maps using diff
refactor gym_latest to save/load maps as needed

rerun h1human, h1control using a fixed set of ~20 maps

Plot stuff and try to dig into a couple of case studies "best" and "worst"?
