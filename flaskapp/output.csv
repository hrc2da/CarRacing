These design choices made the car much slower but makes it stay on the track for longer time periods, which is good. The rest of the design choices (bulging middle, wide front, and low tire radius) were picked by trial and error to help the car turn with generally more precision; sometimes the driver steers the car in the opposite direction of the track, and  these choices reduced the frequency of this type of steering occuring."

Thus I restrict how much he can turn mechanically. I also chose a small engine horsepower and limit the top speed to less than a half. Because I found the driver is still raw, he needs slower speed to give him more tolerance so that he can practice his tactics, like rotation etc. I chose high brake sensitivity for a similar reason, I just want the driver to slow it down more quickly when anything goes wrong."

Additionally increased the steering sensitivity to .56,"I didnt change anything about the car shape at this stage. Since the driver is a beginner, I figured something like is much less important for seeing dramatic improvement. Instead I focussed on making the car a lot easier to handle with the assumption that currently the driver also doesnt have very good reaction time. I initially dramatically reduced the top speed of the car to 30 mph with the expectation that the driver simply needs more time to process when it needs to turn. I also tried to simultaneously improve handling by increasing the tire tread. This way the car wouldn't slide all over the place as a result of a slight push on the pedal. I also reduced the engine size so that a slight push on the pedal would not cause the car to accelerate very quickly. These changes proved to be very fruitful as I saw a top score of about 450. The driver was typically very easily able to make turns and stay on the road. However, the driver wasnt going very fast. Next, I decided to up the top speed to 60 mph. This made the driver's performance much worse as even though it knew about turning, it couldnt turn fast enough for the speed at which it was going. Since I did want to get the car to move fast I decided to just drop the top speed a little to 55 mph but increase the steering sensitivity to 0.55 to account for the fact that the car is moving much faster. This resulted in my best performance of about 770."
